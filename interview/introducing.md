## What Types of Remote/Distributed Team Tools and Software Have You Used and How Did You Use Them?
In my previous remote role, our team used Zoom for daily-standup meeting, in which we discuss any difficulties we come across while we doing the tasks given, what we did the previous day and what are planning to do today.
We were also expected to be available on Slack throughout the day for quick questions or updates. and we used git version control to do on central code base.

I think having regular team meetings over video is a great way to stay connected and keep everyone on the same page

## How Do You Manage Your Time and Stay Organized?
I keep a running daily and weekly to-do list in my notes app and rely heavily on my calendar for meeting and deadline reminders. I usually prioritize my tasks based on due dates and level of importance, and check in with my team every morning to make sure we’re on the same page, as priorities can always shift. I also like to share calendars with my team, so we always have an idea of when everyone is or isn’t available.
